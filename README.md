## 🔍 Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. Leveraging Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and popular data science libraries, we clean, transform, and visualize the data to uncover trends, anomalies, and correlations. The insights generated can inform further analysis, feature engineering, or decision-making processes.

## ✨ Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Detect and handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Compute descriptive statistics and inferential measures.
- **Visualization:**  
  Generate interactive and static charts (bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Derive new features to enhance subsequent modeling efforts.
- **Insights & Conclusions:**  
  Summarize key findings with actionable insights.
